Make a scatter plot in which the x axis shows the athletes' weights and the y axis shows the athletes' heights. Each sport should be represented by a different color point on the plot. Make one scatter plot like this for the 2012 London Olympics, and another for the 1960 Rome Olympics. (Hints: You can create the scatterplots with the .scatterplot() function of the seaborn package. You can place the scatterplots next to each other with the help of the .subplot() function of the matplotlib.pyplot package. You can fix the scales of the axes with the matplotlib.pyplot.xlim([lower, upper]) function. It is not required to use these hints, but seaborn and matplotlib are good libraries to explore for plotting.) <span style=\"color:red\">What is the relationship between the heights and weights of athletes in these sports?</span> "
